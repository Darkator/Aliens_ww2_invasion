		<English>[H1]King Ibn Saud[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of Arabia[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] ?, 1876 – November 9, 1953[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Abdul Aziz ibn Saud was born in Riyadh in central Arabia in 1876. In 1890, at the age of fourteen, Ibn Saud followed his family into exile in Kuwait following the conquest of the family's lands by the rival dynasty of Al Rashid.[PARAGRAPH:2]In the Spring of 1901 Ibn Saud and some relatives, including a half-brother Mohammed, and several cousins, set out on a raiding expedition targeting for the most part tribes associated with the Rashidis. As booty was abundant, with many camels stolen, the raiding party grew to around 200 as tribesmen loyal to the Sauds joined the party. In the Fall, with Ramadan approaching, the group, reduced in number by defections, holed up in the Jabrin Oasis. It may have been only then that Ibn Sa'ud decided to attack Riyadh and regain his family's heritage. On the night of January 15–16, 1902, together with a party of some sixty, including seven relatives and some slaves, he recaptured Riyadh with only twenty; the rest were guarding the camels in an isolated oasis. They had been told to escape if the venture failed. The Rashidi governor of the city, Ajlan, was killed as he fled the attack by Ibn Sa'ud in front of the fort gate. Ibn Sa'ud was considered a "magnetic" leader, and following the capture of Riyadh many former supporters of the House of Saud once again rallied to its support.[PARAGRAPH:2]In the two years following his dramatic seizure of Riyadh, Ibn Sa'ud recaptured almost half of Nejd from the Rashidis. In 1904, however, Ibn Rashid appealed to the Ottoman Empire for assistance in defeating the House of Sa'ud. The Ottomans sent troops to Arabia, setting Ibn Sa'ud on the defensive. The armies of the House of Saud suffered a major defeat on June 15, 1904, but his forces soon regrouped and returned to the offensive as the Turkish troops left the country due to supply problems.[PARAGRAPH:2]Ibn Sa'ud finally consolidated control over the Nejd in 1912 with the help of an organized and well-trained army. In that year he founded the Ikhwan, a militant religious organisation which was to assist in his later conquests. More broadly, he revived his dynasty's traditional alliance with Wahhabism. During World War I the British government attempted to cultivate favor with Ibn Sa'ud via their Political Agent Captain William Shakespear, but this was not seriously continued after Shakespear's unexpectedly early death at the Battle of Jarrab. Instead the British transferred support to Ibn Sa'ud's rival Sherif Hussein ibn Ali, leader of Hejaz, with whom the Sa'uds were almost constantly at war.

		<French>[H1]King Ibn Saud[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of Arabia[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] ?, 1876 – November 9, 1953[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Abdul Aziz ibn Saud was born in Riyadh in central Arabia in 1876. In 1890, at the age of fourteen, Ibn Saud followed his family into exile in Kuwait following the conquest of the family's lands by the rival dynasty of Al Rashid.[PARAGRAPH:2]In the Spring of 1901 Ibn Saud and some relatives, including a half-brother Mohammed, and several cousins, set out on a raiding expedition targeting for the most part tribes associated with the Rashidis. As booty was abundant, with many camels stolen, the raiding party grew to around 200 as tribesmen loyal to the Sauds joined the party. In the Fall, with Ramadan approaching, the group, reduced in number by defections, holed up in the Jabrin Oasis. It may have been only then that Ibn Sa'ud decided to attack Riyadh and regain his family's heritage. On the night of January 15–16, 1902, together with a party of some sixty, including seven relatives and some slaves, he recaptured Riyadh with only twenty; the rest were guarding the camels in an isolated oasis. They had been told to escape if the venture failed. The Rashidi governor of the city, Ajlan, was killed as he fled the attack by Ibn Sa'ud in front of the fort gate. Ibn Sa'ud was considered a "magnetic" leader, and following the capture of Riyadh many former supporters of the House of Saud once again rallied to its support.[PARAGRAPH:2]In the two years following his dramatic seizure of Riyadh, Ibn Sa'ud recaptured almost half of Nejd from the Rashidis. In 1904, however, Ibn Rashid appealed to the Ottoman Empire for assistance in defeating the House of Sa'ud. The Ottomans sent troops to Arabia, setting Ibn Sa'ud on the defensive. The armies of the House of Saud suffered a major defeat on June 15, 1904, but his forces soon regrouped and returned to the offensive as the Turkish troops left the country due to supply problems.[PARAGRAPH:2]Ibn Sa'ud finally consolidated control over the Nejd in 1912 with the help of an organized and well-trained army. In that year he founded the Ikhwan, a militant religious organisation which was to assist in his later conquests. More broadly, he revived his dynasty's traditional alliance with Wahhabism. During World War I the British government attempted to cultivate favor with Ibn Sa'ud via their Political Agent Captain William Shakespear, but this was not seriously continued after Shakespear's unexpectedly early death at the Battle of Jarrab. Instead the British transferred support to Ibn Sa'ud's rival Sherif Hussein ibn Ali, leader of Hejaz, with whom the Sa'uds were almost constantly at war. Despite this, the British entered into a treaty in December 1915 which made the lands of the House of Sa'ud a British protectorate.

However, the oligarchic and decentralized confederation of the Old Republic, dominated by landed interests, in effect, showed little concern for promoting industrialization, urbanization, and other broad interests of the new middle class.[PARAGRAPH:2]Bourgeois and military discontent, heightened by the Great Depression's impact on the Brazilian economy, led to bloodless coup d'&#233;tat on October 24, 1930 that ousted President Washington Lu&#237;s and his heir-apparent J&#250;lio Prestes. J&#250;lio Prestes at this point was the new elected president of Brazil, but the whole process was questioned, fraud denounced, and before the new president took office, the so-called revolutionary movement started, joining the regional leaderships in several Brazilian states dissatisfied with the political dominance exerted by the state of S&#227;o Paulo at that point in time. Anticlimactic as it was, this was a watershed in Brazilian history — a liberal, bourgeois revolution that ushered out the political preeminence of the paulista coffee oligarchs. The military, traditionally active in Brazilian politics, installed Vargas as "provisional president." A populist governor of Rio Grande do Sul and the former presidential candidate of the Liberal Alliance, Vargas had been "defeated" by Prestes in a disputed election earlier that year.[PARAGRAPH:2]Vargas was a wealthy pro-industrial nationalist and anti-communist who favored capitalist development and liberal reforms, but actually posed a serious threat to the elite paulista gentry. This opposition would later be radicalized in the 1932 movement that was initially aimed at the establishment of a new constitution. Vargas's Liberal Alliance drew support from wide ranges of Brazil's burgeoning urban middle class and a group of tenentes, who had grown frustrated to some extent with the politics of coronelismo and caf&#233; com leite.[PARAGRAPH:2]Although Vargas ran strictly from within the partisan elite during this unsuccessful 1930 campaign on a populist and protectionist platform, the coup d'&#233;tat laid the foundations of a modern Brazil that is highly industrialized, but still considered a part of the Third World.[PARAGRAPH:2]However moderate these aims were, opposition arose among the powerful paulista coffee oligarchs who had grown accustomed to their domination of Brazilian politics. This opposition ignited the military movement of 1932 when the paulista elite was defeated, a situation that marked the definitive transition from the Brazilian "old republic" and its entry into a new economic cycle not any more focused on the coffee and other commodity production, but on stimulating industrial development. His tenuous coalition also lacked a coherent program, being committed to a broad vision of modernization, but little else more definitive. Having to balance such conflicting ideological constituencies, regionalism, and economic interests in such a vast, diverse, and socio-economically varied nation would, thus, not only explain the constancy that marked Vargas's long career — abrupt shifts in alliances and ideologies, but also his eventual dictatorship - modeled surprisingly along the lines of European Fascism, considering the liberal roots of his regime. Vargas, in effect, sought to forge a corporatist, centralized state along Fascist lines to mitigate these disparate class interests and to quell disorder during a chaotic interwar era.</English>

		<Spanish>[H1]Prime Minister King[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Prime Minister of Canada[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] December 17, 1874 – July 22, 1950[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]King was born in Berlin, Ontario (now Kitchener) to John King and Isabel Grace Mackenzie. His grandfather was William Lyon Mackenzie, first mayor of Toronto and leader of the Upper Canada Rebellion in 1837. King had three siblings: older sister Isabel "Bella" Christina Grace (1873–1915), younger sister Janet "Jennie" Lindsey (1876–1962), and younger brother Dougall Macdougall "Max" (1878–1922).[PARAGRAPH:2]King attended Berlin Central School (now Suddaby Public School) and Berlin High School (now Kitchener-Waterloo Collegiate and Vocational School) and held five university degrees. He obtained three from the University of Toronto: B.A. 1895, LL.B. 1896, and M.A. 1897. While attending the University of Toronto he met nine of his cabinet ministers during his time as prime minister, all of whom, including him, were members of the Kappa Alpha Society.[2] After studying at the University of Chicago, Mackenzie King proceeded to Harvard University, receiving an M.A. in political economy 1898 and a Ph.D. 1909. He is the only Canadian Prime Minister to have earned a doctorate.[PARAGRAPH:2]King worked as a newspaper reporter for the Toronto Globe while studying at the University of Toronto. In 1900, he became Canada's first Deputy Minister of Labour. He was first elected to Parliament as a Liberal in a 1908 by-election, and was re-elected in a 1909 by-election following his appointment as the first-ever Minister of Labour. He lost his seat in the 1911 general election, which saw the Conservatives defeat his Liberals.[PARAGRAPH:2]Following his party's defeat, he went to the United States to work for the Rockefeller family's Foundation at their invitation, heading their new Department of Industrial Relations. He formed a close working association and friendship with the family leader, John D. Rockefeller Jr., advising him through the turbulent period of the 1914 strike and Ludlow massacre at a family-owned coal company in Colorado, which subsequently set the stage for a new era in labor management in America.[PARAGRAPH:2]He returned to Canada to run in the 1917 election, which focused almost entirely on the conscription issue, and lost again, due to his opposition to conscription, which was supported by the majority of English Canadians.</Spanish>

Of very humble origins, Batista began working from an early age. A self-educated man, he attended school at night and is said to have been a voracious reader. Batista was considered socially a mulatto (mixed African and European blood). He bought a ticket to Havana and joined the army in 1921. [3] Sergeant Batista was the union leader in Cuba's soldiers, and the leader of the 1933 "Sergeants' Revolt" which replaced the Provisional Government of Carlos Manuel de C&#233;spedes, at the request of the anti-Machado coalition, who had previously ousted Gerardo Machado. It is generally conceded that U.S. Special Envoy Sumner Welles approved of this since it was a fait accompli. C&#233;spedes was a well-respected civil engineer and the most successful minister in the Machado government but lacked a political coalition that could sustain him. Initially a pentarchical presidency with five members, one each from the anti-Machado coalition, was created but within days the representative for the students and professors of the Universtity of Havana, Ram&#243;n Grau, was made president and Batista became the Army Chief of Staff, with the rank of Colonel, and effectively controlled the presidency[citation needed]. The majority of the commissioned officer corps was 'forcefully retired' (meaning executed).[PARAGRAPH:2]During this period, Batista violently suppressed a number of attempts to defeat his control. This included the quashing of an uprising in the ancient Atar&#233;s fort (Havana) by Blas Hern&#225;ndez, a rural guerrilla who had fought Gerardo Machado. Many of those who surrendered were executed. Another attempt was the attack on the Hotel Nacional where Cuban former army officers of the Cuban Olympic rifle team (including one Enrique Ros) put up stiff resistance until they were defeated. Here again Batista troops executed a good number of the surrendered. The irony is that many of these officers had helped overthrow Machado. There were many other often minor and almost unrecorded attempted revolts against Batista. These too were bloodily suppressed. These minor revolts included one in Guam&#225;, a place in the Sierra Maestra south of Guisa, where the followers of an anti-Batista guerrilla leader known as Gamboa (apparently a member, or former member, of the Antonio Guiteras anti-Machado guerrillas) were defeated and dispersed.[PARAGRAPH:2]Grau was president for just over 100 days before being replaced by Carlos Mendieta y Montefur (11 months), then Jos&#233; Barnet y Vinajeras (5 months), and then Miguel Mariano G&#243;mez (7 months) before Federico Laredo Br&#250; managed to rule from December 1936 to October 1940.[PARAGRAPH:2]On January 14 1934, Batista forced provisional president Ram&#243;n Grau San Mart&#237;n to resign, and he appointed Carlos Mendieta to the presidency. Within five days, the U.S. recognized Cuba's new government.[PARAGRAPH:2]For the next decade Batista ran the country from the background, using puppet presidents [Carlos Mendieta (1934-35), Jos&#233; A. Barnet (1935-36), Miguel Mariano G&#243;mez (1936) and Federuco Laredo Br&#250; (1936-40)] and having his way with the government, which continued a thirty-year tradition of corruption.[PARAGRAPH:2]Batista was well liked by American interests, who feared Grau's socialistic reforms and saw him as a stabilizing force with respect for American interests. It was in this time period that Batista formed a renowned friendship and business relationship with gangster Meyer Lansky that lasted over three decades.[PARAGRAPH:2]Through Lansky, the mafia knew they had a friend in Cuba. Gangster Lucky Luciano, after being deported to Italy in 1946, went to Havana with a false passport. A summit at Havana's Hotel Nacional, with mobsters such as Frank Costello, Vito Genovese, Santo Trafficante Jr., Moe Dalitz and others, confirmed Luciano's authority over the U.S. mob, and coincided with Frank Sinatra's singing debut in Havana. It was here that Lansky gave permission to kill Bugsy Siegel for skimming construction money from the Flamingo in Las Vegas.[PARAGRAPH:2]Many of Batista's enemies faced the same fate as the ambitious Siegel. One of his most bitter opponents, Antonio Guiteras (founder of the student group J&#243;ven Cuba) was gunned down by government forces in 1935 while waiting for a boat in Matanzas province.

Initially a pentarchical presidency with five members, one each from the anti-Machado coalition, was created but within days the representative for the students and professors of the Universtity of Havana, Ram&#243;n Grau, was made president and Batista became the Army Chief of Staff, with the rank of Colonel, and effectively controlled the presidency[citation needed]. The majority of the commissioned officer corps was 'forcefully retired' (meaning executed).[PARAGRAPH:2]During this period, Batista violently suppressed a number of attempts to defeat his control. This included the quashing of an uprising in the ancient Atar&#233;s fort (Havana) by Blas Hern&#225;ndez, a rural guerrilla who had fought Gerardo Machado. Many of those who surrendered were executed. Another attempt was the attack on the Hotel Nacional where Cuban former army officers of the Cuban Olympic rifle team (including one Enrique Ros) put up stiff resistance until they were defeated. Here again Batista troops executed a good number of the surrendered. The irony is that many of these officers had helped overthrow Machado. There were many other often minor and almost unrecorded attempted revolts against Batista. These too were bloodily suppressed. These minor revolts included one in Guam&#225;, a place in the Sierra Maestra south of Guisa, where the followers of an anti-Batista guerrilla leader known as Gamboa (apparently a member, or former member, of the Antonio Guiteras anti-Machado guerrillas) were defeated and dispersed.[PARAGRAPH:2]Grau was president for just over 100 days before being replaced by Carlos Mendieta y Montefur (11 months), then Jos&#233; Barnet y Vinajeras (5 months), and then Miguel Mariano G&#243;mez (7 months) before Federico Laredo Br&#250; managed to rule from December 1936 to October 1940.[PARAGRAPH:2]On January 14 1934, Batista forced provisional president Ram&#243;n Grau San Mart&#237;n to resign, and he appointed Carlos Mendieta to the presidency. Within five days, the U.S. recognized Cuba's new government.[PARAGRAPH:2]For the next decade Batista ran the country from the background, using puppet presidents [Carlos Mendieta (1934-35), Jos&#233; A. Barnet (1935-36), Miguel Mariano G&#243;mez (1936) and Federuco Laredo Br&#250; (1936-40)] and having his way with the government, which continued a thirty-year tradition of corruption.[PARAGRAPH:2]Batista was well liked by American interests, who feared Grau's socialistic reforms and saw him as a stabilizing force with respect for American interests. It was in this time period that Batista formed a renowned friendship and business relationship with gangster Meyer Lansky that lasted over three decades.[PARAGRAPH:2]Through Lansky, the mafia knew they had a friend in Cuba. Gangster Lucky Luciano, after being deported to Italy in 1946, went to Havana with a false passport. A summit at Havana's Hotel Nacional, with mobsters such as Frank Costello, Vito Genovese, Santo Trafficante Jr., Moe Dalitz and others, confirmed Luciano's authority over the U.S. mob, and coincided with Frank Sinatra's singing debut in Havana. It was here that Lansky gave permission to kill Bugsy Siegel for skimming construction money from the Flamingo in Las Vegas.[PARAGRAPH:2]Many of Batista's enemies faced the same fate as the ambitious Siegel. One of his most bitter opponents, Antonio Guiteras (founder of the student group J&#243;ven Cuba) was gunned down by government forces in 1935 while waiting for a boat in Matanzas province. Others just seemed to disappear into thin air.</Spanish>

He was born in Kožlany, Bohemia (then part of the Austrian Empire).[PARAGRAPH:2]He was born into a peasant family in a small village of Kožlany near Rakovn&#237;k, ca. 60 km west of Prague. He spent much of his youth in Vinohrady district of Prague, where he attended grammar school from 1896 to 1904. After studying at the Faculty of Philosophy of Charles University in Prague, he traveled to Paris and continued his studies at the Sorbonne and at the Independent School of Political and Social Studies (&#201;cole Libre des Sciences Politiques). He completed his first degree in Dijon, where he received his Doctorate of Laws in 1908. Then he taught for three years at the Prague Academy of Commerce, and after his habilitation in the field of philosophy in 1912, he became a lecturer in sociology at Charles University.[PARAGRAPH:2]During World War I he was one of the leading organizers of an independent Czechoslovakia abroad. He organized a Czech pro-independence anti-Austrian secret resistance movement called "Maffia". In September, 1915, he went into exile where in Paris he made intricate diplomatic efforts to gain recognition from France and the United Kingdom for the Czechoslovak independence movement, as he was from 1916–1918 a Secretary of the Czechoslovak National Council in Paris and Minister of the Interior and of Foreign Affairs within the Provisional Czechoslovak government.[PARAGRAPH:2]From 1918–1935, he was first and the longest serving Foreign Minister of Czechoslovakia, and from 1920–1925 and 1929–1935 a member of the Parliament. He represented Czechoslovakia in talks of the Treaty of Versailles. In 1921 he was a professor and also from 1921–1922 Prime Minister. Between 1923–1927 he was a member of the League of Nations Council (serving as president of its committee from 1927–1928). He was a renowned and influential figure at international conferences, such as Genoa 1922, Locarno 1925, The Hague 1930, and Lausanne in 1932.[PARAGRAPH:2]He was a member of the Czechoslovak National Socialist Party (till 1925 called Czechoslovak Socialist Party) and a strong Czechoslovakist - he did not consider Slovaks and Czechs to be separate ethnicities.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1935 he succeeded Tom&#225;š Garrigue Masaryk to become President.

His father, Arthur Hyde, was Church of Ireland rector of Kilmactranny, County Sligo from 1852 to 1867, and it was here that Hyde spent his early years. [1]. In 1867, his father was appointed prebendary and rector of Tibohine, and the family moved to neighbouring Frenchpark, in County Roscommon. While a young man he became fascinated with hearing the old people in the locality speak the Irish language. He was influenced in particular by the gameskeeper Seamus Hart and the wife of his friend, Mrs Connolly. He was crushed when Seamus Hart died (Douglas was 14) and his interest in the Irish language, which was the first language he began to study in any detail, and which was his own undertaking, flagged for a while. However, he visited Dublin a number of times and realised that there were groups of people, just like him, interested in Irish, a language looked down on at the time by many and seen as backward and old-fashioned.[PARAGRAPH:2]Rejecting family pressure that like past generations of Hydes he follow a career in the Church, Hyde instead became an academic. He entered Trinity College, Dublin where he became fluent in French, Latin, German, Greek and Hebrew. His passion for Irish, already a language in severe decline, led him to found the Gaelic League, or in Irish, Conradh na Gaeilge, in the hope of saving it from extinction.[PARAGRAPH:2]Hyde's Irish language movement, initially seen as eccentric, gained a mass following throughout the island. He published a pamphlet called The Necessity for De-Anglicising Ireland, arguing that Ireland should follow her own traditions in language, literature and even in dress.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1893 he helped found the Gaelic League. It was set up to encourage the preservation Irish culture, its music, dances, and language. Many of the new generation of Irish leaders who played a central role in the fight for Irish independence in the early twentieth century, including Patrick Pearse, &#201;amon de Valera (who married his Irish teacher Sin&#233;ad Flanagan), Michael Collins, and Ernest Blythe first became politicised and passionate about Irish independence through their involvement in Conradh na Gaeilge or (Gaelic League).[PARAGRAPH:2]Hyde himself, however, felt uncomfortable at the growing politicisation of his movement (which had been infiltrated by the Irish Republican Brotherhood, just like the Irish Volunteers and the Gaelic Athletic Association) and resigned the presidency in 1915; he was replaced by the radical political activist and Irish-language teacher, Patrick Pearse (1879-1916).[PARAGRAPH:2]Hyde had no association with Sinn F&#233;in and the Independence movement. He did, however, accept appointment to Seanad &#201;ireann, the upper house of the Irish Free State's Oireachtas (parliament) from his friend, the President of the Executive Council W.T. Cosgrave, after the creation of the new state.[PARAGRAPH:2]However, his tenure was shortlived. In November 1925, the house moved from being an appointed to an elected body. Hyde contested the election, which was based on one state-wide constituency, but a smear by a far right-wing organisation, the Catholic Truth Society of Ireland, based on his supposed support for divorce (in fact he was anti-divorce) and his Protestantism, and promoted by the CTS secretary in the letters column of the Irish Independent, fatally damaged his chances and he lost his seat.[PARAGRAPH:2]He returned to academia, as Professor of Irish at University College Dublin, where one of his students was future Attorney-General and President of Ireland, Cearbhall &#211; D&#225;laigh.[PARAGRAPH:2]In April 1938, by now retired from academia, Douglas was plucked from retirement by Taoiseach &#201;amon de Valera and again appointed to Seanad &#201;ireann. Again his tenure proved short, even shorter than before. But this time it was because, on the suggestion of Fine Gael in inter-party negotiations to choose a first President of Ireland, Hyde had been chosen to take on the office. He was selected for a number of reasons.[PARAGRAPH:2]Hyde was inaugurated as the first President of Ireland in June 1938 and moved into the long vacant Viceregal Lodge. Hyde's recitation of the Presidential Declaration of Office in his native Roscommon Irish dialect, remains one of the few recordings of a dialect that has long disappeared and of which Hyde himself was one of the last users.</English>

		<German>[H1]President Hyde[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]President of Ireland[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] 17 January 1860 – 12 July 1949[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Hyde was born at Longford House in Castlerea in County Roscommon, while his mother was on a short visit there. His father, Arthur Hyde, was Church of Ireland rector of Kilmactranny, County Sligo from 1852 to 1867, and it was here that Hyde spent his early years. [1]. In 1867, his father was appointed prebendary and rector of Tibohine, and the family moved to neighbouring Frenchpark, in County Roscommon. While a young man he became fascinated with hearing the old people in the locality speak the Irish language. He was influenced in particular by the gameskeeper Seamus Hart and the wife of his friend, Mrs Connolly. He was crushed when Seamus Hart died (Douglas was 14) and his interest in the Irish language, which was the first language he began to study in any detail, and which was his own undertaking, flagged for a while. However, he visited Dublin a number of times and realised that there were groups of people, just like him, interested in Irish, a language looked down on at the time by many and seen as backward and old-fashioned.[PARAGRAPH:2]Rejecting family pressure that like past generations of Hydes he follow a career in the Church, Hyde instead became an academic. He entered Trinity College, Dublin where he became fluent in French, Latin, German, Greek and Hebrew. His passion for Irish, already a language in severe decline, led him to found the Gaelic League, or in Irish, Conradh na Gaeilge, in the hope of saving it from extinction.[PARAGRAPH:2]Hyde's Irish language movement, initially seen as eccentric, gained a mass following throughout the island. He published a pamphlet called The Necessity for De-Anglicising Ireland, arguing that Ireland should follow her own traditions in language, literature and even in dress.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1893 he helped found the Gaelic League. It was set up to encourage the preservation Irish culture, its music, dances, and language. Many of the new generation of Irish leaders who played a central role in the fight for Irish independence in the early twentieth century, including Patrick Pearse, &#201;amon de Valera (who married his Irish teacher Sin&#233;ad Flanagan), Michael Collins, and Ernest Blythe first became politicised and passionate about Irish independence through their involvement in Conradh na Gaeilge or (Gaelic League).[PARAGRAPH:2]Hyde himself, however, felt uncomfortable at the growing politicisation of his movement (which had been infiltrated by the Irish Republican Brotherhood, just like the Irish Volunteers and the Gaelic Athletic Association) and resigned the presidency in 1915; he was replaced by the radical political activist and Irish-language teacher, Patrick Pearse (1879-1916).[PARAGRAPH:2]Hyde had no association with Sinn F&#233;in and the Independence movement. He did, however, accept appointment to Seanad &#201;ireann, the upper house of the Irish Free State's Oireachtas (parliament) from his friend, the President of the Executive Council W.T. Cosgrave, after the creation of the new state.[PARAGRAPH:2]However, his tenure was shortlived. In November 1925, the house moved from being an appointed to an elected body. Hyde contested the election, which was based on one state-wide constituency, but a smear by a far right-wing organisation, the Catholic Truth Society of Ireland, based on his supposed support for divorce (in fact he was anti-divorce) and his Protestantism, and promoted by the CTS secretary in the letters column of the Irish Independent, fatally damaged his chances and he lost his seat.[PARAGRAPH:2]He returned to academia, as Professor of Irish at University College Dublin, where one of his students was future Attorney-General and President of Ireland, Cearbhall &#211; D&#225;laigh.[PARAGRAPH:2]In April 1938, by now retired from academia, Douglas was plucked from retirement by Taoiseach &#201;amon de Valera and again appointed to Seanad &#201;ireann. Again his tenure proved short, even shorter than before. But this time it was because, on the suggestion of Fine Gael in inter-party negotiations to choose a first President of Ireland, Hyde had been chosen to take on the office.

He supported his family (including his mother and 7 younger siblings) from age 16 on after the death of his father. By the age of 18 he had worked as a tax collector, a printer's devil, and a jailkeeper. Although he left school at the age of eleven, he used every opportunity to educate himself and read widely throughout his life, especially works of history.[PARAGRAPH:2]C&#225;rdenas originally set his sights at becoming a teacher, but was drawn into politics and the military during the Mexican Revolution after Victoriano Huerta overthrew President Francisco Madero. He backed Plutarco El&#237;as Calles, and after Calles became president, C&#225;rdenas became governor of Michoac&#225;n in 1928. He became known for his progressive program of building roads and schools, promoting education, land reform and social security.[PARAGRAPH:2]Calles continued to dominate Mexico after his presidency with administrations that were his puppets. After having two of his hand-picked men put into the position, the PNR balked at his first choice, Manuel P&#233;rez Trevi&#241;o, in 1934. Instead they selected C&#225;rdenas to be the ruling party's presidential candidate, and Calles went along with it, thinking he could control him as he had the previous two. This however, was not so. C&#225;rdenas's first move once he took office late in 1934 was to have his presidential salary cut in half. Even more surprising moves would follow. After establishing himself in the presidency, in 1936 C&#225;rdenas had Calles and dozens of his corrupt associates arrested or deported to the United States, a decision that was greeted with great enthusiasm by the majority of the Mexican public.[PARAGRAPH:2]C&#225;rdenas subsequently decreed the end of the use of capital punishment (in Mexico, usually in the form of a pelot&#243;n de fusilamiento, a firing squad). Capital punishment has been banned in Mexico since that time. The control of the republic by Cardenas and the PRI predecessor Partido de la Revolucion Mexicana without widespread bloodshed effectively signalled the end of rebellions that began with the 1910 Mexican Revolution.[PARAGRAPH:2]Cardenas was perhaps the only Mexican President who never employed armored cars (coches blindados) or bodyguards to protect himself. In the Presidential campaign of 1934, he travelled through much of the republic that was not accessible by train, by auto and horseback, accompanied only by a chauffeur and an aide-de-camp. This fearlessness generated widespread respect for Cardenas by the Mexican electorate. He became the first occupant of the current official Mexican presidential residence of Los Pinos, and converted the previous residence, the ostentatious Spanish viceregal palace Chapultepec Castle, into the Mexican National Museum of History.[PARAGRAPH:2]Russian exile Leon Trotsky was welcomed into Mexico by Cardenas, reportedly to counter accusations that Cardenas was a stalinista. Cardenas, like his 1920's predecessor Alvaro Obregon, understood that left wing and labor union support was critical to maintain control of the republic. The bloated and corrupt CROM union of Luis Morones was marginalized as Cardenas promoted the "purified" Confederaci&#243;n de Trabajadores de M&#233;xico of socialist Vicente Lombardo Toledano. The CTM and Toledano in turn supported Cardenas' deportation of ex-President Calles.[PARAGRAPH:2]C&#225;rdenas is considered by many historians to be the creator of a political system that lasted in Mexico until the end of the 1980s. Central to this project was the organization of corporatist structures for trade unions, campesino (peasant) organizations, and middle-class professionals and office workers within the reorganized ruling party, now renamed the Party of the Mexican Revolution (PRM). During Cardenas's presidency, the government expropriated and redistributed millions of acres of hacienda land to peasants, and urban and industrial workers gained unprecedented unionization rights and wage increases. The railway Ferrocarriles Nacionales de M&#233;xico was nationalized in 1938 and put under a "workers administration". However, Cardenas and subsequent presidents also used the PRM and its successor, the Institutional Revolutionary Party or PRI, to maintain political control; leaders of the worker and campesino organizations delivered votes and suppressed protests in exchange for personal favors and concessions to their constituencies.[PARAGRAPH:2]In the elections of 1940, Cardenas on principle refused to make an outright endorsement of the PRM nominee Manuel Avila Camacho against Camacho's opponent, Juan Andreu Almazan, insisting on open debate and free elections. The elections, however did not follow the pattern Cardenas wished. The campaign was peppered with violent incidents and on election day, the opposing parties hijacked numerous polling places and each issued their own "election results". After "official" results declared Avila Camacho as winner, Almazan threatened revolt then attempted to set up a parallel government and congress, nevertheless, Avila Camacho assumed office, his inauguration attended by US Vice President Henry A. Wallace.</English>

During Cardenas's presidency, the government expropriated and redistributed millions of acres of hacienda land to peasants, and urban and industrial workers gained unprecedented unionization rights and wage increases. The railway Ferrocarriles Nacionales de M&#233;xico was nationalized in 1938 and put under a "workers administration". However, Cardenas and subsequent presidents also used the PRM and its successor, the Institutional Revolutionary Party or PRI, to maintain political control; leaders of the worker and campesino organizations delivered votes and suppressed protests in exchange for personal favors and concessions to their constituencies.[PARAGRAPH:2]In the elections of 1940, Cardenas on principle refused to make an outright endorsement of the PRM nominee Manuel Avila Camacho against Camacho's opponent, Juan Andreu Almazan, insisting on open debate and free elections. The elections, however did not follow the pattern Cardenas wished. The campaign was peppered with violent incidents and on election day, the opposing parties hijacked numerous polling places and each issued their own "election results". After "official" results declared Avila Camacho as winner, Almazan threatened revolt then attempted to set up a parallel government and congress, nevertheless, Avila Camacho assumed office, his inauguration attended by US Vice President Henry A.

W wieku 18 lat mia&#244; ju&#235; za sob&#225; prac&#234; jako poborca podatkowy, pomocnik w drukarni i stra&#235;nik wi&#234;zienny.

Popar&#244; Plutarco Eliasa Callesa i gdy ten zosta&#244; prezydentem, mianowa&#244; w 1928 roku Cardenasa gubernatorem Michoacan.

Po dw&#243;ch latach Cardenas doprowadzi&#244; do zaaresztowania Callesa i kilkunastu jego skorumpowanych wsp&#243;&#244;pracownik&#243;w. Cz&#234;&#228;&#226; z nich deportowa&#244; nast&#234;pnie do USA, a posuni&#234;cia te spotka&#244;y si&#234; z wielkim entuzjazmem wi&#234;kszo&#228;ci opinii publicznej.[PARAGRAPH:2]Cardenas zlikwidowa&#244; kar&#234; &#228;mierci, zwyczajowo wykonywan&#225; przez pluton egzekucyjny (pelot&#243;n de fusilamiento).

Podczas kampanii prezydenckiej w roku 1934, aby dosta&#226; si&#234; do region&#243;w, gdzie nie dociera&#244;a kolej, podr&#243;&#235;owa&#244; samochodem i konno, w towarzystwie jedynie szofera i adiutanta.

		<Spanish>[H1]President Cardenas[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]President of Mexico[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] May 21, 1895 - October 19, 1970[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]L&#225;zaro C&#225;rdenas was born into a lower-middle class family in the village of Jiquilpan, Michoac&#225;n. He supported his family (including his mother and 7 younger siblings) from age 16 on after the death of his father. By the age of 18 he had worked as a tax collector, a printer's devil, and a jailkeeper. Although he left school at the age of eleven, he used every opportunity to educate himself and read widely throughout his life, especially works of history.[PARAGRAPH:2]C&#225;rdenas originally set his sights at becoming a teacher, but was drawn into politics and the military during the Mexican Revolution after Victoriano Huerta overthrew President Francisco Madero. He backed Plutarco El&#237;as Calles, and after Calles became president, C&#225;rdenas became governor of Michoac&#225;n in 1928. He became known for his progressive program of building roads and schools, promoting education, land reform and social security.[PARAGRAPH:2]Calles continued to dominate Mexico after his presidency with administrations that were his puppets. After having two of his hand-picked men put into the position, the PNR balked at his first choice, Manuel P&#233;rez Trevi&#241;o, in 1934. Instead they selected C&#225;rdenas to be the ruling party's presidential candidate, and Calles went along with it, thinking he could control him as he had the previous two. This however, was not so. C&#225;rdenas's first move once he took office late in 1934 was to have his presidential salary cut in half. Even more surprising moves would follow. After establishing himself in the presidency, in 1936 C&#225;rdenas had Calles and dozens of his corrupt associates arrested or deported to the United States, a decision that was greeted with great enthusiasm by the majority of the Mexican public.[PARAGRAPH:2]C&#225;rdenas subsequently decreed the end of the use of capital punishment (in Mexico, usually in the form of a pelot&#243;n de fusilamiento, a firing squad). Capital punishment has been banned in Mexico since that time. The control of the republic by Cardenas and the PRI predecessor Partido de la Revolucion Mexicana without widespread bloodshed effectively signalled the end of rebellions that began with the 1910 Mexican Revolution.[PARAGRAPH:2]Cardenas was perhaps the only Mexican President who never employed armored cars (coches blindados) or bodyguards to protect himself. In the Presidential campaign of 1934, he travelled through much of the republic that was not accessible by train, by auto and horseback, accompanied only by a chauffeur and an aide-de-camp. This fearlessness generated widespread respect for Cardenas by the Mexican electorate. He became the first occupant of the current official Mexican presidential residence of Los Pinos, and converted the previous residence, the ostentatious Spanish viceregal palace Chapultepec Castle, into the Mexican National Museum of History.[PARAGRAPH:2]Russian exile Leon Trotsky was welcomed into Mexico by Cardenas, reportedly to counter accusations that Cardenas was a stalinista.

He emigrated to New Zealand in 1907. There he worked in a variety of jobs, as a miner, flax cutter and storeman, before becoming involved in the union movement. Savage was initially opposed to the formation of the Labour party as he viewed it as not sufficiently socialistic. Instead he became the chairman of the New Zealand Federation of Labour, known as the Red Feds.[PARAGRAPH:2]In the 1911 election Savage unsuccessfully stood as the Socialist candidate for Auckland Central.

Instead he became the chairman of the New Zealand Federation of Labour, known as the Red Feds.[PARAGRAPH:2]In the 1911 election Savage unsuccessfully stood as the Socialist candidate for Auckland Central. During World War I he opposed conscription, arguing that the conscription of wealth should precede the conscription of men. After the war Savage was elected to Parliament as a Labour candidate. He was one of eight Labour members of parliament and became the party leader following the death of Harry Holland. He helped engineer the Labour/Ratana alliance.[PARAGRAPH:2]During the depression, Savage toured the country, and became an iconic figure. An excellent speaker, Savage became the most visible politician in the country and led Labour to victory in the 1935 election. The first Labour government swiftly proved popular and easily won the 1938 elections with an increased majority. Savage was suffering from cancer at the time, but had delayed seeking treatment to participate in the election campaign. Savage was to die from this cancer in 1940.[PARAGRAPH:2]A life long bachelor, Savage brought an almost religious fervour to his politics. This, and his death while in office, has made him become something of an iconic figure to the Left. The architect of the welfare state, his picture was reportedly found in many Labour supporters' homes. Savage rejected Rationalism during later life and returned to his Catholic roots. A Requiem Mass was offered at his state funeral. While younger generations are less aware of him, he is still revered by many older New Zealanders.[PARAGRAPH:2]Savage is buried at Bastion Point on Auckland City's Waitemata Harbour waterfront in the Savage Memorial, a clifftop mausoleum crowned by a tall minaret, and fronted by an extensive memorial garden and reflective pool.</Spanish>

He was the second monarch of the Pahlavi dynasty and the last Shah of the Iranian monarchy.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Shah came to power during World War II, after an Anglo-Soviet invasion forced the abdication of his father, Reza Shah. Mohammad Reza Shah's rule oversaw the nationalization of the Iranian oil industry under prime minister Mohammad Mossadegh. During the Shah's reign, Iran celebrated 2,500 years of continuous monarchy since the founding of the Persian Empire by Cyrus the Great. His White Revolution, a series of economic and social reforms intended to transform Iran into a global power, succeeded in modernizing the nation, nationalizing many natural resources and extending suffrage to women, among other things. However, a partial failure of the land reform, the lack of democratization as criticized by some of his opponents, as well as the decline of the traditional power of the Shi'a clergy due to parts of the reforms, increased opposition to his authority.[PARAGRAPH:2]While a Muslim himself, the Shah gradually lost support with the Shi'a clergy of Iran, particularly due to his strong policy of Westernization and recognition of Israel. Clashes with the religious right, increased communist activity, Western interference in the economy, and a 1953 period of political disagreements with Mohammad Mossadegh (in which each side accused the other of staging a coup, eventually leading to Mossadegh's downfall) would cause an increasingly autocratic rule. Various controversial policies were enacted, including the banning of the Tudeh Party and the oppression of dissent by Iran's intelligence agency, SAVAK; Amnesty International reported that Iran had as many as 2,200 political prisoners in 1978. By 1979, the political unrest had transformed into a revolution which, on January 16, forced the Shah to leave Iran after 37 years of rule. Soon thereafter, the revolutionary forces transformed the government into an Islamic republic.</English>

As prime minister of the Republican coalition government with the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), Aza&#241;a carried out the major reforms anticipated by the republican program: the reformation of the Spanish Army - to determine its size in agreement with the capacity of the country, the agrarian reform, and the education reform - suppressing religious activities in favor of the promotion of a secular state.[PARAGRAPH:2]Those issues, along with the existing social agitation in a major portion of the population would lead Aza&#241;a into conflict with various factions, especially the Roman Catholic Church and elements within the military, resulting in the events of Casas Viejas, Castilblanco y Arnedo, which forced his resignation on September 8, 1933.

The Popular Front's victory in the February, 1936 elections led to serious discontent among the traditionally conservative political groups in Spain, primarily the military, the Church, and political parties such as CEDA and the Falange.

He studied in the Universidad Complutense, the Cisneros Institute and the Agustinos of El Escorial. He was awarded a Lawyer's licence by the University of Zaragoza in 1897, and a doctorate by the Universidad Complutense in 1900.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1909 he achieved a position at the Main Directorate of the Registries and practiced the profession of civil law notary, and traveled to Paris in 1911. He became involved in politics and in 1914 joined the Reformist Republican Party led by Melqu&#237;ades &#193;lvarez. He collaborated in the production of various newspapers, such as El Imparcial and El Sol. During World War I he covered operations on the Western Front for various newspapers. His treatment was very sympathetic to the French, and he may have been subsidized by French military intelligence. Afterwards he directed the magazines Pluma and Espa&#241;a between 1920 and 1924, founding the former with his brother-in-law Cipriano Rivas Cherif. He was secretary of the Ateneo de Madrid (1913-1920), becoming its president in 1930. He was a candidate for the province of Toledo in 1918 and 1923, but lost on both occasions. In 1926 he founded Acci&#243;n Republicana with Jos&#233; Giral.[PARAGRAPH:2]A strong critic of the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera, Aza&#241;a published an energetic manifesto against the dictator and King Alfonso XIII in 1924. He later participated in the Pact of San Sebasti&#225;n in 1930, which would form the nucleus of the future Republican government that arose after favorable results to the republican candidacies in the municipal elections of April 12, 1931 and the subsequent abandonment of the country by King Alfonso.[PARAGRAPH:2]Provisional President of the Spanish Republic Niceto Alcal&#225;-Zamora named Aza&#241;a Minister of War in the provisional Government of the Second Spanish Republic on April 14. Aza&#241;a then replaced Alcal&#225;-Zamora as provisional prime minister in October of that year due to Alcal&#225;-Zamora's resignation over the subject of the status of the religious question, which is to say primarily the role of the Spanish Catholic Church, in the Republic. As prime minister of the Republican coalition government with the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), Aza&#241;a carried out the major reforms anticipated by the republican program: the reformation of the Spanish Army - to determine its size in agreement with the capacity of the country, the agrarian reform, and the education reform - suppressing religious activities in favor of the promotion of a secular state.[PARAGRAPH:2]Those issues, along with the existing social agitation in a major portion of the population would lead Aza&#241;a into conflict with various factions, especially the Roman Catholic Church and elements within the military, resulting in the events of Casas Viejas, Castilblanco y Arnedo, which forced his resignation on September 8, 1933. The triumph of the coalition formed by Alejandro Lerroux's Radical Republican Party and the Confederaci&#243;n Espa&#241;ola de Derechas Aut&#243;nomas (CEDA) of Jos&#233; Mar&#237;a Gil-Robles y Qui&#241;ones on November 19, 1933, caused him temporarily to withdraw from politics and return to literary activity.[PARAGRAPH:2]Aza&#241;a's self-imposed political retreat lasted only a short while; in 1934 he founded the Republican Left party, the fusion of Acci&#243;n Republicana with the Radical Socialist Republican Party, led by Marcelino Domingo, and the Organizaci&#243;n Republicana Gallega Aut&#243;noma (ORGA) of Santiago Casares Quiroga. In 1934 serious revolutionary events took place in Asturias and Barcelona. Accused of instigating the riots, he was jailed on board the destroyer Sanchez Barc&#225;iztegui anchored in the port in Barcelona, but was later acquitted.[PARAGRAPH:2]After his release from prison in January 1935, Aza&#241;a initiated a political campaign that gave rise to the creation of the Spanish Popular Front, a major left-wing coalition that won the elections of February 16, 1936. The Popular Front's victory in the February, 1936 elections led to serious discontent among the traditionally conservative political groups in Spain, primarily the military, the Church, and political parties such as CEDA and the Falange. Many historians consider the Popular Front's electoral victory as the first event in the immediate chain of events that lead to the military uprising against the Second Republic on July 17-18, 1936.</Spanish>

		<English>The Spanish Civil War was a major conflict in Spain that started after an attempted coup d'&#233;tat committed by parts of the army against the government of the Second Spanish Republic. The Civil War devastated Spain from July 17, 1936 to April 1, 1939, ending with the victory of the rebels and the founding of a dictatorship led by the Nationalist General Francisco Franco. The supporters of the Republic, or Republicans (republicanos), gained the support of the Soviet Union and Mexico; while the followers of the Rebellion, also called Nationalists (nacionales), received the support of the major European Axis powers of Italy and Germany. The war increased tensions in the lead up to the Second World War and became in some cases a world war by proxy, with Germany in particular using the war as a rehearsal for many of the blitzkrieg tactics it later used in the war in Europe. The war became notable for the passion and political division it inspired, and for atrocities committed on both sides of the conflict.</English>

		<English>The events of March 12, 1938, marked the culmination of historical cross-national pressures to unify the German populations of Austria and Germany under one nation. However, the 1938 Anschluss, regardless of its popularity, was enacted by Germany. Earlier, Hitlerian Germany had provided support for the Austrian National Socialist Party (Austrian Nazi Party) in its bid to seize power from Austria's Austrofascist leadership. Fully devoted to remaining independent but amidst growing pressures, the chancellor of Austria, Kurt Schuschnigg, tried to hold a plebiscite. Although he expected Austria to vote in favour of maintaining autonomy, a well-planned internal overthrow by the Austrian Nazi Party of Austria's state institutions in Vienna took place on March 11, prior to the vote. With power quickly transferred over to Germany, the Wehrmacht troops entered Austria to enforce the Anschluss. The Nazis held a plebiscite within the following month, where they received 99.73% of the vote. No fighting ever took place and the strongest voices against the annexation, particularly Fascist Italy, France and the United Kingdom (the "Stresa Front"), were powerless or, in case of Italy, appeased. The Allies were, on paper, committed to upholding the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, which specifically prohibited the union of Austria and Germany. Nevertheless, the Anschluss was among the first major steps in Adolf Hitler's long-desired creation of an empire including German-speaking lands and territories Germany had lost after World War I. Already prior to the 1938 annexation, the Rhineland was retaken and the Saar region was returned to Germany after fifteen years of occupation. After the Anschluss, the predominantly German Sudetenland of Czechoslovakia was taken, with the rest of the country becoming a protectorate to Germany in 1939. That same year, Memelland was returned from Lithuania, the final event and antecedent before the invasion of Poland, prompting World War II.</English>

No fighting ever took place and the strongest voices against the annexation, particularly Fascist Italy, France and the United Kingdom (the "Stresa Front"), were powerless or, in case of Italy, appeased. The Allies were, on paper, committed to upholding the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, which specifically prohibited the union of Austria and Germany. Nevertheless, the Anschluss was among the first major steps in Adolf Hitler's long-desired creation of an empire including German-speaking lands and territories Germany had lost after World War I. Already prior to the 1938 annexation, the Rhineland was retaken and the Saar region was returned to Germany after fifteen years of occupation. After the Anschluss, the predominantly German Sudetenland of Czechoslovakia was taken, with the rest of the country becoming a protectorate to Germany in 1939. That same year, Memelland was returned from Lithuania, the final event and antecedent before the invasion of Poland, prompting World War II.</Spanish>

		<English>The Munich Agreement (Czech: Mnichovsk&#225; dohoda; Slovak: Mn&#237;chovsk&#225; dohoda; German: M&#252;nchner Abkommen) was an agreement regarding the Sudetenland Crisis among the major powers of Europe after a conference held in Munich, Germany in 1938 and signed on September 29. The Sudetenland was of immense strategic importance to Czechoslovakia, as most of its border defenses were situated there. The purpose of the conference was to discuss the future of Czechoslovakia in the face of territorial demands made by German dictator Adolf Hitler, and it ended up dividing that state between Nazi Germany, Poland and Hungary. Because Czechoslovakia was not invited to the conference, the Munich Agreement is commonly called the Munich Dictate by Czechs and Slovaks. The phrase Munich betrayal is also frequently used because military alliances between Czechoslovakia and France and between France and Britain were not honoured. The agreement is considered by many as the quintessential example of appeasement. Because Hitler soon violated the terms of the agreement, it has often been cited in support of the principle that tyrants should never be appeased.</English>

		<Italian>Uk&#244;ad Monachijski zosta&#244; zawarty w dniu 29 wrze&#228;nia 1938 roku przez g&#244;&#243;wne mocarstwa europejskie w celu za&#235;egnania tzw. kryzysu sudeckiego. Sudety, znajduj&#225;ce si&#234; na zachodniej granicy Czechos&#244;owacji, przedstawia&#244;y dla tego pa&#241;stwa olbrzymie znaczenie strategiczne, gdy&#235; mie&#228;ci&#244;a si&#234; w nich wi&#234;kszo&#228;&#226; umocnie&#241; obronnych kraju. Celem konferencji w Monachium by&#244;o zadecydowanie o losie Czechos&#244;owacji, wobec kt&#243;rej hitlerowskie Niemcy wysuwa&#244;y roszczenia terytorialne. Zako&#241;czy&#244;a si&#234; ona podzia&#244;em kraju mi&#234;dzy Niemcy i W&#234;gry (Zaolzie przy&#244;&#225;czono do Polski na podstawie dwustronnego porozumienia 2 pa&#233;dziernika). Czesi i S&#244;owacy, kt&#243;rych nie zaproszono do udzia&#244;u w konferencji, nazywaj&#225; uk&#244;ad "dyktatem monachijskim". R&#243;wnie cz&#234;sto mowa jest o "zdradzie w Monachium", gdy&#235; zgadzaj&#225;c si&#234; na &#235;&#225;dania Hitlera, Zach&#243;d nie wype&#244;ni&#244; swoich sojuszniczych zobowi&#225;za&#241; wobec Czechos&#244;owacji. Konferencja monachijska jest najbardziej jaskrawym przyk&#244;adem polityki appeasementu, czyli ust&#234;pstw, wobec Niemiec. Wobec niedotrzymania przez Hitlera postanowie&#241; uk&#244;adu, Monachium s&#244;u&#235;y za przestrog&#234;, &#235;e z tyranami nie wolno negocjowa&#226;.</Italian>
